Some of these could change once UCP hits GA, but it is quite unlikely.\r\n1. Linux kernel 3.16 or later. (Older kernel versions will work with UCP, but >=3.16 is required if you want to leverage docker's uber cool multi host networking capabilities.)\r\n2. Docker version >=1.9 pre-installed on all nodes (Recommend that at least 2 nodes are available)\r\n3. Access to super user mode (sudo or root)\r\n4. (Ability to) Open firewall ports (incoming into the UCP master: 443, 2376, 12376, 12379, 12380, 12381, 12382)\r\n\r\n### Default installation\r\nLet's make one of the nodes as the UCP server / master. The other(s) would be the agent(s) or slave(s). Installation involves installation and configuration of UCP components on both sets of nodes. Ideally in a production setup a configuration management engine such as Puppet/Chef would be leveraged to automate this task.\r\nTo perform the installation manually, follow the steps below.\r\nOn one of the node (preferably the beefier one, which has nothing else other than default OS and related utilities installed), run this command.\r\n`docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name ucp dockerorca/ucp install -i`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Re-installing (when things go wrong or just for the heck of it)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Uninstalling\r\n\r\n\r\n### External CA\r\n\r\n### External Logging\r\n\r\n### External User repository (LDAP)\r\n","google":"UA-1020564-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
